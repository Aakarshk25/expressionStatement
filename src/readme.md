to use or call java script code you have to give {} Braces or curley brackets.
note => {} in braces you only elegible to write js Expression
but we can't able to write js statements.

Explanation => n summary, curly braces in React's JSX syntax are used to include JavaScript expressions, which produce values and can be evaluated within JSX. However, JavaScript statements, which do not produce values, cannot be used directly within JSX.

ex. of statements => loops, if else , what ever the things taht are nit completed
or near future we were able to update or keep changing in the code .
